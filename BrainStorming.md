# AI Voice Agent & Dashboard for E-Commerce Sellers

## **Target Audience**
- **E-commerce Merchants:**  
  Small to mid-size online sellers on platforms like Shopify and Amazon, as well as independent e-commerce sites. These merchants juggle high order volumes and need efficient customer outreach.
- **COD Networks:**  
  Sellers on cash-on-delivery networks (e.g., YouCan, Dropify) where verifying orders by phone is common. These markets (MENA/Asia) require multilingual support (e.g., Arabic/English).
- **Geographies:**  
  Sellers in regions with Do-Not-Disturb telecom rules or multi-language customers need robust call management and language options.

## **Seller Needs & Pain Points**
1. **Order Verification:**  
   Manual calls to confirm orders are time-consuming and error-prone. Unverified orders lead to shipping mistakes and wasted inventory.  
2. **High Returns/Cancellations:**  
   Unverified or fraudulent orders inflate return rates. Automation can reduce the return ratio.  
3. **Rescheduling Deliveries:**  
   Customers often request delivery rescheduling, which is challenging to manage at scale. AI calls can automate this process.  
4. **Order Cancellations:**  
   Handling cancellations manually is inefficient. AI can update orders instantly upon customer request.  
5. **Upselling & Cross-Selling:**  
   Sellers want the agent to suggest related products or discounts subtly during order confirmation.  
6. **Multilingual Support:**  
   Voice agents fluent in multiple languages and regional accents are essential for global markets.  
7. **Analytics Gap:**  
   Sellers lack insights into call performance. Dashboards with metrics like confirmation rates and customer feedback can optimize operations.  
8. **Labor & Cost:**  
   Manual calling is resource-intensive and expensive. AI can save significant time and costs.  
9. **Privacy & Compliance:**  
   Sellers must comply with GDPR, TCPA, and other telecom regulations while securing customer data.

   Configure calling windows, retry schedules, and pause campaigns.
